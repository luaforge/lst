lst - LuaStringTemplate
========================

This project is a Lua port of StringTemplate[1], a popular and powerful Java
template engine.  This will incrementally support various StringTemplate
features.  As of this writting the current version of StringTemplate is 3.1.  I
expect it will take several releases of lst before it has the same capabilities
as the original.


Supported Template File Syntax
==============================

TODO - Detail the exact supported template group file syntax.


Using lst
=========

TODO - Provide detailed examples of how lst is used from within a Lua script.
