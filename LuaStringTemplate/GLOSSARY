Attribute

	"Something" that has a string value, or has properties with a string
	value.  This terminology comes from StringTemplate, where an attribute
	is an object that has a ToString() method.  An attribute can be
	multi-valued; the same attribute name refers to a list of individual
	objects.

	In LuaStringTemplate an attribute is typically a string or a table.

	TODO - Need examples of attributes.

Group

	A collection of templates.  They can be multiple template files in a
	directory tree, or a single group file with multiple template
	definitions.

lst
	See LuaStringTemplate.  'lst' is the short form of the project name for
	use in LuaForge.

StringTemplate

	The original Java StringTemplate engine with ports in Python and C#,
	"for generating source code, web pages, emails, or any other formatted
	text output. StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code
	generators, multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization.
	... Its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly enforces
	model-view separation unlike other engines.

Template

	From Wikipedia: any processing element that can be combined with a data
	model and processed by a template engine to produce a result document.

	You can think of it as a "document with holes," or as a way to describe
	an output grammar.
