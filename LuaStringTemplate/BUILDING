External Dependencies
=====================

The following are the current known dependencies lst has on 3rd party software,
and the version of each.  lst may work with later releases of these
dependencies, but I can't guarantee it.

  Lua 5.1.x - http://www.lua.org/

  LPeg 0.8  - http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/


Building
========

make
make check
make install


Notes
=====

Running 'make check' will run a suite of lunit (http://www.mroth.net/lunit/)
unit tests.  Rather than make it a separate dependency, lunit 0.4 has been
included directly in the src/tests directory.  This ensures that the unit tests
can always be run, which hopefully means they will be run often.
